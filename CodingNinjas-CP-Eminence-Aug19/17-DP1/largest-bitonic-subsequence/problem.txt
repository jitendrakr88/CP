You are given an array of positive integers as input. Write a code to return the length of the largest such sub-array in which the values are arranged first in strictly ascending order and then in strictly descending order.
Such a sub-array is known as bitonic sub-array. A purely increasing or purely decreasing subsequence will also be considered as a bitonic sequence with the other part empty.
Note that the elements in bitonic sub-array need not be consecutive in the given array but the order should remain same.

Input Format:
Line 1 : A positive Integer N, i.e., the size of array
Line 2 : N space-separated integers as elements of the array

Output Format:
Length of Largest Bitonic Sub-Array

Input Constraints:
1<= N <= 10^5

Sample Input 1:
6
15 20 20 6 4 2

Sample Output 1:
5

Sample Output 1 Explanation:
Here, longest Bitonic sub-array is {15, 20, 6, 4, 2} which has length = 5.

Sample Input 2:
2
1 5

Sample Output 2:
2

Sample Input 3:
2
5 1

Sample Output 3:
2
